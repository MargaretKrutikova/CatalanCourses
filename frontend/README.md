# Catalan courses

I got tired of the poor interface of https://inscripcions.cpnl.cat/, I can't see the overview of the courses
with the schedule and location, I can't choose a course of my liking, I don't learn Catalan.

So I parsed their website and plotted them in Google Maps. Now I can see what courses are close to my home and
work, what schedule they have etc and can find a course that suits my personal schedule. Let's hope I get a
place.

Frustration led me to building this, frustration is a great feeling that drives you to learn Catalan, and
`golang`.
